  "message": "<think>\nAlright, I need to help the user by providing a witty quotation related to questions, research, or enquiry. They also mentioned including a citation and nothing else. So first, I should think about famous quotes that fit these themes.\n\nI remember Albert Einstein has some great quotes on curiosity and inquiry. One of them is \"The important thing is not to stop questioning.\" That's perfect because it directly relates to questions and research.\n\nNow, checking the structure: the user wants just the quote and a citation. I should make sure there are no additional explanations or text. So, I'll format it as [Quote] - [Author], keeping it concise.\n\nI think this fits well. It's witty and encapsulates the essence of continuous enquiry, which aligns with what the user is asking for.\n</think>\n\n\"The important thing is not to stop questioning.\" â€“ Albert Einstein",
