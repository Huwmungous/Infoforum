  "message": "Faiss (Metric based index) is a library for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors, developed by Facebook AI Research. However, there are several alternatives to Faiss that you might consider depending on your specific use case:\n\n1. Annoy: It's designed to be easy to use and fast in production systems. However, it only supports angular distance and euclidean distance (L2).\n\n```python\nfrom annoy import AnnoyIndex\nt = AnnoyIndex(f, 'angular')  # Length of item vector that will be indexed\nfor i in range(len(data)):\n    t.add_item(i, data[i])\nt.build(10) # 10 trees\n```\n\n2. NMSLIB: It's a comprehensive library for non-metric (and metric) space libraries, which allows you to create and manipulate indices of points. It supports a variety of distance metrics and object types.\n\n```python\nimport nmslib\nindex = nmslib.init(method='hnsw', space='cosinesimil')\nindex.addDataPointBatch(data)\nindex.createIndex({'post': 2}, print_progress=True)\nneighbors = index.knnQuery(query, k=10)\n```\n\n3. Scikit-Learn: It has a NearestNeighbors class that allows for the computation of nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces and supports different types of distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan etc). \n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors\nnn = NearestNeighbors(2, algorithm='ball_tree').fit(X)\ndistances, indices = nn.kneighbors(X)\n```\n\n4. HNSWlib: It's a library for approximate nearest neighbor search. It's designed to find the k-nearest neighbors of a point in high dimensional space efficiently and is specifically optimized for large datasets.\n\n```python\nimport hnswlib\np = hnswlib.Index(space='l2', dim=len(data[0]))  # possible options for `space` are l2, cosine or ip\np.init_index(max_elements=100, ef_construction=100, M=16)\np.add_items(data, list(range(len(data))))\n```\n\n5. RAPIDS: It's a suite of open-source software libraries for executing end-to-end data science and accelerating time to insights for large scale datasets. It supports nearest neighbors search in its GPU-accelerated kNN indexing library cuML.\n\nRemember that the choice of library can depend on your specific use case, such as memory requirements or speed vs accuracy considerations. It might also be beneficial to profile and benchmark each option to determine which is most suitable for your needs.\n",
