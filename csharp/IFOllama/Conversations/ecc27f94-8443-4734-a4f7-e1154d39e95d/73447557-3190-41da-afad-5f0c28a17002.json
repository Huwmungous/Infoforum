  "message": "There are a few libraries you could consider based on your needs:\n\n1. **Sentence Transformers**: This is one of the most popular libraries used for creating sentence or paragraph embeddings, which can be useful if you're working with text data. It supports a wide range of models and offers easy-to-use APIs.\n\n2. **Hugging Face Transformers**: If you're dealing with NLP tasks, this is probably the most popular library to use for generating context vectors. Hugging Face provides pre-trained models like BERT or RoBERTa that you can fine-tune for your specific task.\n\n3. **PyTorch**: While not specifically used for creating embeddings, PyTorch is a powerful machine learning library and could be useful in constructing the context vectors for your Ollama prompt. You'd need to manually define the model architecture and training loop though.\n\n4. **TensorFlow**: Similar to PyTorch, TensorFlow offers a wide range of models that you can fine-tune or use directly based on your needs.\n\nRemember that choosing the right library depends on your specific requirements, including the nature of your data and the task at hand. Make sure to thoroughly evaluate each option before making a decision.\n",
