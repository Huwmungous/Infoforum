They want just the quote and citation without any extra text.\n\nHmm, I need to find a quote that's both clever and relevant. Maybe something from a well-known figure in science or philosophy since they often talk about inquiry.\n\nEinstein comes to mind because he's iconic for his curiosity-driven approach. I remember he said something about not knowing the answers, but asking the right questions. That fits perfectly here.\n\nLet me check the exact wording to make sure it’s accurate. Yes, \"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough\" is a common paraphrase of his thoughts on simplicity in understanding.\n\nI think this quote will resonate with the user because it emphasizes the importance of clear questioning and the value of understanding deeply before attempting answers.\n</think>\n\n\"If you can't explain it to a six-year-old, you don't really understand it yourself.\" — Albert Einstein",
